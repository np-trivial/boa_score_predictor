# boa_score_predictor
a little experiment I did using Splunk MLTK to try to learn some basic ML use. I used it to predict the score for the upcoming (2024) Bands of American Grant Nationals results, which as of this writing, begin tomorrow.

# Future considerations
- try harvesting directly from official results using https://tabula-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tabula.html
- try other models
- add other features
  - performance order
  - judging panel
- more data cleaning/normalization
